Quantum Psychology
====================


I have seen some quantum psychology. What I am going to do is to develop the dynamics of quantum psychology. I good starting point is to inspect the theory of love.

The key to this is that DO NOT take it as the truth. Every theory we developed is just an representation of something.


A theory of love. The first article about this theory is here (http://multiverse.lamost.org/blog/6207) in Chinese.
