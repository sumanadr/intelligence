Quantum Psychology
====================


I have seen some quantum psychology. What I am going to do is to develop the dynamics of quantum psychology. I good starting point is to inspect the theory of love.

The key to this is that DO NOT take it as the truth. Every theory we developed is just an representation of something.


A theory of love. The first article about this theory is here (http://multiverse.lamost.org/blog/6207) in Chinese.

Welcome to the QuantumLove wiki!

What's the difference between the probability theory of the tossing-coin experiment and quantum superposition theory?

Probabilistic:
The identification of reality?

Bayesian:
What is committed to be the prior?


The physics behind the superposition principle is really weird.

[Psychology Facts](./psychology.md)

1. pair opposites of emotions in part of quantum emotional states
2. Geometry of Quantum Psychology: Since we are dealing with pair states, Bloch sphere is enough.
3. A Quantum explanation of BOTH perceptual arrow of time and thermodynamical time. Two related papers:

   a. http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v2/n11/abs/nphys444.html
   b. http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.79.061103

   I can feel it's close.
