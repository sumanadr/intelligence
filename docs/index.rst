Intelligence
==============================


There is a deeply hidden secret, one that killed many, one that saved many. Intelligence, the holy grail of human society, is the ultimate science of all time. As I think about intelligence of many forms, I feel the urge to learn more about them. Hence the notes.

A particular interest is to find resonances in these intelligence. A chinese proverb says, little force can move a huge rock (四两拨千斤). Resonances are one of the maneuvers to deflect a huge rock.
