Alzheimer's Disease
=========================


Pathology
-----------------------------


1. Amyloid-beta deposition in grey matter for Alzheimer's disease. Accumulation of amyloid-beta then leads to oligomers which finally form plaques. It can **alter intracellular Ca2+ levels**. [LaFerla2008]_
2. Amyloid-beta can transmit between human [Jaunmuktane2015]_

Network Dysfunction
----------------------------------

1. Hypersynchrony and altered oscillatory rhythmic activity [Palop2016]_
