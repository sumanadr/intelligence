Competition betwen Subnetworks
---------------------------------------

1. Winnerless Competion: network activity spontaneously switch between same type of subnetworks
2. Cell assemblies: some neurons in mammalian neocrotex connected specifically with higher connection probabilities and stronger weights.

RSN (Resting State Networks)
-------------------------------

A series of functional networks maintain a ligh level of coherence even the brain is at rest [Deco2010]_.

Whole-Brain Computational Connectomics
--------------------------------------------


Whole-brain computational models help neuropsychiatric disorders [Deco2014].
