Photoplethysmography
=======================



We are interested in the waveforms.

1. Pulsatile physiological waveform (AC, ~1Hz): cardiac synchronous changes
2. Slow varying baseline (DC): respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity, thermoregulation

The important factors are

1. the blood volume,
2. blood vessel wall movement,
3. the orientation of red blood cells (RBC).
4. Obsorptions:[Allen2007]_

   1. Optical water window: Absorbs ultraviolet and infrared; melanin also absorbes shorter wavelengths.
   2. Isobestic wavelength:
   3. Tissue penetration depth:

5. Multi-bilateral site photoplethysmography



Pulse Wave

1. Pulse distortions and alterations at periphery
2. Damage and disease in the vascular
