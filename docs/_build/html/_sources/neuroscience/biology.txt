Biology
==============




Terms & Concepts
--------------------



1. cell structure (check figure)
	1. Nucleus: administration office
	2. smooth endoplasmic reticulum: high way
	3. rough endoplasmic reticulum
	4. Mitochondrion: power plant
	5. Cytoplasm
	6. Centriole: combines the surrounding structure to be the centrosome
	7. Lysosome: trash can, and recycle system
	8. plasma membrane
	9. Golgi complex: post office
2. Secretory
	1. Produced  at RER
	2. Wrapped at Golgi
3. Cell division cycle: For neurons, G0 is when the cells decides to divide or differentiate
	1. Interphase
		a. G0->G1->S->G2
	2. Mitosis
4. Cell membrane
	1. G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR): 7 transmembrane
		a. G proteins have three subunits: alpha beta gamma, which are inactive if no GPCR's are in action
		b. Receptors for G Protein and important for signaling pathway: ligand binds to GPCR -> GPCR conformational change -> alpha sub-unit exchange its binded GDP for a GTP (now it binds a GTP, and both alpha subunit and beta-gamma complex are active) -> regulate target proteins which are responsible for second messengers -> GTP on alpba subunit then hydrolyze to GDP -> everything comes back together to the original state
5. Protein phosphatase: removes phosphate group from phosphorylated amino acid.
6. Phosphorylation: transfer phosphate group to enzymes
7. Kinase: transfer phosphate group from high-energy to another place
8. Tyrosine kinase: transfer phosphate group to a protein
9. Homeobox: a dna sequence that regulates anatomical development




Techniques
--------------



1. Western blot: separate protein by length of polypeptides
	a. Detergent -> gel electrophoresis -> transfer & incubation
2. Northern blot: RNA
3. Southern blot: DNA
	a. DNA fragments->gel electrophoresis->ultraviolet
4. PCR
	a. DNA fragmentation->PCR machine->gel electrophoresis->ultraviolet
5. Clone: somatic cell nucleus + zygote (without nucleus)



Receptors and ligands
------------------------------


1. Agonist
	a. Has the same effect as a neurotransmitter
2. Antagonist
	a. Doesn't really work like neurotransmitter but binds to receptor




Neurodevelopment
------------------------------




1. Process:  Fertilized egg -> caps -> gastrulation-> neural plate->neural tube-> Anterior-posterior patterning (now we have differences between two ends)-> Dorsal-ventral patterning (differences between dorsal and ventral)
2. Gastrulation: three layers : ectoderm, endoderm, then mesoderm
3. Polarization of Neurons:
	a. 5 stages: first 2 symmetric, 3 with axon begins, 4 growing in length and branching, 5 morphogenesis  and synapse
	b. Filopodia:
	c. Lamellipodia:
	d. Framework: tublin + actin
4. ECM: extracellular matrix:
	a. Scaffolding the organ
